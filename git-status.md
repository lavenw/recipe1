Definition: git status
The git status command is an essential tool in the Git version control system, allowing users to quickly determine the current state of their repository and see what changes have been made since the last commit.
Open the Git Panel: After installing the Git extension, you will see a new Git tab in the left sidebar. Click on it to open the Git panel.
View Repository Status: In the Git panel, you will find a list of files that have been modified, added, or deleted, similar to the output of "git status" in the terminal. You can also view untracked files and branch information. 
Overall, JupyterLab's Git extension provides a graphical interface for common Git operations, making it easy to access the same information and perform actions without needing to use the terminal.
